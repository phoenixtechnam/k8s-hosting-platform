# Phase 1 Roadmap: Single Region MVP (Weeks 1-12)

> **Goal:** Deploy a working hosting platform on Hetzner Frankfurt with first test client migrated by Week 12.
>
> **Scope:** Single region, no geographic sharding yet, no app catalog, no advanced restore features.
>
> **Resources:** Assumes 2-3 people (1 DevOps, 1 Backend, 1 Frontend) or adjust timelines accordingly.
>
> **Success Criteria:**
> - 1 real Plesk customer successfully migrated
> - All core APIs working (create client, manage domains, upload files)
> - Basic monitoring in place (uptime, errors)
> - Zero data loss during migration

---

## Current Status (as of March 29, 2026)

### Completed

- **Backend API (Fastify + TypeScript + Drizzle ORM):** Fully implemented with all core CRUD endpoints for clients, domains, databases, workloads, and users. Cursor-based pagination, standard error envelope, and JWT auth middleware all functional.
- **Admin Panel (React 18 + Vite + shadcn/ui):** Client management, domain management, database management, user/RBAC management, DNS server configuration, hosting settings, protected directories, and workload catalog UI all built.
- **Client Panel (React 18 + Vite + shadcn/ui):** Dashboard, domain list, database list, email/mailbox management, file manager integration, and profile settings implemented.
- **Shared API Contracts (`packages/api-contracts`):** Single source of truth for all Zod schemas and TypeScript types. Backend validates inbound requests; frontend uses inferred types.
- **Database Schema:** Full MariaDB schema with 30+ tables covering clients, domains, workloads, databases, email (email_domains, mailboxes, mailbox_access, email_aliases), notifications, backup configurations, SMTP relay configs, audit logs, application catalog, SSL certificates, and SFTP users. Drizzle ORM schema in sync.
- **Email System:** Email domain management with DKIM/SPF/DMARC provisioning, mailbox CRUD, email aliases, mailbox access control, and SMTP relay configuration. Stalwart + Roundcube K8s manifests ready.
- **Workload Catalog (ADR-025):** Multi-repo sync from external GitHub repositories. Container images and application catalog synced and displayed in admin panel.
- **DNS Integration:** Multi-provider DNS server support (PowerDNS, RNDC, Cloudflare, Route53, Hetzner, mock). Primary/CNAME/secondary zone modes with domain verification.
- **Auth & OIDC:** JWT Bearer token auth with RBAC roles (admin, billing, support, read-only). OIDC provider configuration with Dex integration. Break-glass local auth fallback.
- **Notifications System:** In-app notifications with read/unread tracking, subscription expiry alerts.
- **Backup Configuration:** SSH and S3 backup target management with test connectivity and scheduling.
- **K8s Manifests:** Base Kustomize manifests for backend, admin panel, client panel, database, Redis, ingress, RBAC, network policies, resource quotas, namespaces, and Flux GitOps.
- **SFTP Gateway:** K8s manifest for SFTP file access on port 2222.
- **WAF (ModSecurity):** OWASP CRS configuration with platform-specific exclusions.
- **E2E Tests (Playwright):** 43 passing tests covering admin and client panel flows.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflows for backend, frontend-admin, and frontend-client.

### In Progress

- K8s manifest generation from workload/domain configuration (dynamic per-client pod provisioning)
- Domain verification automation (TXT record checking)
- Secondary DNS zone transfer support
- Admin user invitation flow
- Deployment runbook finalized (see `DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md`)

### Not Yet Started

- Migration service (Plesk extractor + importer) -- Weeks 9-10
- Load testing -- Week 11
- First production migration -- Week 12
- Monitoring stack deployment (Prometheus + Alertmanager + Loki)

## Phase 1 Timeline Overview

**Total:** 12 weeks (3 months)
**Team allocation:** Full-time for all 3 people
**Infrastructure cost:** ~€50/month (single Hetzner server)

## Prerequisites: External Services (Infrastructure Project)

> **Per ADR-022, DNS, VPN mesh, and IAM are provided by the infrastructure project and must be running before Phase 1 begins.**

The following services are deployed and managed by the separate infrastructure project. Verify they are operational before starting Week 1:

- **PowerDNS** (ns1 primary + ns2 secondary) — authoritative DNS for hosted domains
- **NetBird** WireGuard mesh — admin VPN access to cluster and management plane
- **Dex** OIDC provider — identity and authentication for platform services

---

## Week 1-2: Infrastructure Setup (DevOps Lead)

### Goals
- Provision Hetzner server (4vCPU, 8GB RAM, ~€50/mo)
- Install k3s Kubernetes cluster
- Set up persistent storage (local-path provisioner; Longhorn in Phase 2)
- Configure networking (Ingress, cert-manager)
- Set up external SFTP backup

### GitHub Setup

**Create repository:**

```bash
gh repo create hosting-platform/hosting-platform --private --clone
cd hosting-platform
git checkout -b staging
git push -u origin staging
```

**Create branches & protection rules:**

```bash
# main: requires 2 approvals, all CI checks must pass
gh api repos/hosting-platform/hosting-platform/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["backend-ci","frontend-admin-ci","frontend-client-ci"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":2}' \
  --field restrictions=null

# staging: requires 1 approval
gh api repos/hosting-platform/hosting-platform/branches/staging/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["backend-ci"]}' \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1}' \
  --field restrictions=null
```

**GitHub Teams:**

| Team | Members | Permission |
|------|---------|------------|
| `platform-admins` | Team leads (1-2) | Admin |
| `platform-devs` | All developers | Write |
| `ci-bots` | Machine accounts | Write (for manifest commit-back) |

### Deliverables

**GitHub Issues to Create:**

| # | Title | Label | Owner |
|---|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Provision Hetzner VPS (4vCPU/8GB/Debian 13) | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 2 | Install k3s single-node cluster (with `--flannel-backend=none`) | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 3 | Install Calico CNI (NetworkPolicy enforcement from day one) | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 4 | Install NGINX Ingress Controller (DaemonSet, hostPort 80/443) | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 5 | Install cert-manager + Let's Encrypt ClusterIssuer | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 6 | Install Sealed Secrets controller | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 7 | Verify NetBird VPN mesh connectivity to cluster (provided by infrastructure project) | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 8 | Verify PowerDNS reachable and API integration working (provided by infrastructure project) | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 9 | Configure offsite backup (Restic → Hetzner StorageBox via NetBird mesh) | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 10 | Install Prometheus + Alertmanager + Loki (Grafana optional — access via port-forward) | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 11 | Install Flux v2 (GitOps controller) | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |
| 12 | Take Hetzner server snapshot (pre-workload baseline) | `infrastructure` `phase:1` | DevOps |

> **Phase 1 resource optimization (single-node 4vCPU/8Gi):**
> - **No Longhorn** — Use k3s built-in `local-path` provisioner. Longhorn replication factor 1 adds overhead with zero benefit on one node. Deferred to Phase 2 (multi-node).
> - **No Harbor** — Use GitHub Container Registry or `ctr image import` for pre-built images. Harbor (~1Gi RAM) is too heavy for single-node. Deferred to Phase 2.
> - **Dedicated pods per client** (ADR-024) — Each client gets their own pod in a `client-{id}` namespace. Scale-to-zero via KEDA for idle sites.
> - See `INFRASTRUCTURE_SIZING.md` for the full resource budget.

### GitHub CI/CD

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci-backend.yml`

Full YAML is in `CICD_PIPELINE_REQUIREMENTS.md §P1.1`. Summary:
- Triggered on push/PR to `main` or `staging` affecting `backend/**`
- Jobs: lint → typecheck → migrations → unit tests → integration tests → Docker build → Trivy scan → push to GHCR (Harbor in Phase 2)

**File:** `backend/package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "platform-backend",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsx watch src/server.ts",
    "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.build.json",
    "start": "node dist/server.js",
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:unit": "vitest run tests/unit",
    "test:integration": "vitest run tests/integration",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext .ts",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "db:migrate": "knex migrate:latest",
    "db:migrate:rollback": "knex migrate:rollback",
    "db:migrate:rollback:all": "knex migrate:rollback --all",
    "db:seed": "knex seed:run",
    "bench": "tsx tests/benchmarks/run.ts"
  }
}
```

### Database Schema Location

Database schema DDL lives at `backend/migrations/`. Each migration is a numbered file, e.g.:

```
backend/migrations/
├── 001_create_clients.ts
├── 002_create_users.ts
├── 003_create_domains.ts
├── 004_create_workloads.ts
├── 005_create_databases.ts
├── 006_create_backups.ts
├── 007_create_audit_logs.ts
└── 008_create_restore_jobs.ts
```

The canonical schema is documented in `/config/Server Infrastructure/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`. Migrations must be kept in sync with that document.

## GitHub Management Best Practices

### Branch Strategy (Git Flow)

```
main          ← production-ready code only; tagged releases
  └── staging ← integration branch; auto-deploys to staging
        └── feature/your-feature   ← individual feature work
        └── fix/your-bugfix        ← bug fixes
        └── infra/your-change      ← infrastructure changes
```

Rules:
- All work happens in feature branches off `staging`
- Feature branches merge into `staging` via PR (1 approval)
- `staging` merges into `main` via PR (2 approvals) only when staging deploy is verified
- Never commit directly to `main` or `staging`
- Delete feature branches after merge

### Pull Request Workflow

1. **Create feature branch from staging:**

   ```bash
   git checkout staging && git pull
   git checkout -b feature/client-search-api
   ```

2. **Commit with meaningful messages:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(backend): add full-text search to GET /api/v1/admin/clients

   Adds MySQL FULLTEXT index on (company_name, company_email, contact_email).
   Implements ?search= query param with < 500ms performance target.
   Closes #28"
   ```

3. **Push and open PR:**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/client-search-api
   gh pr create --base staging --title "feat: client search API" --body "Closes #28"
   ```

4. **GitHub PR template** (`.github/pull_request_template.md`):

   Template content is in `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`.

5. **Code review & merge:**
   - At least 2 approvals required for main
   - 1 approval required for staging
   - All CI checks must pass

### Issue Tracking

**Issue Labels:**

| Label | Color | Usage |

| `phase:2` | `#5319e7` | Phase 2 scope |

**Issue Template:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md` — see `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`.

---

## GitHub Project Management

**Create GitHub Project** for Phase 1:

Go to: `github.com/orgs/hosting-platform/projects/new` → "Board" layout.

Columns: `Backlog` | `This Week` | `In Progress` | `In Review` | `Done`

**Weekly Sync:**

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Pull items from backlog into "This Week"; assign owners; check CI health |
| Wednesday | Review blockers; pair on stuck issues; check open PRs |
| Friday | Merge ready PRs; deploy staging; close completed issues; post weekly update |

---

## Secrets Management (GitHub Secrets)

**Create organization secrets for sensitive data:**

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `KUBECONFIG_B64` | `cat ~/.kube/config \| base64 -w 0` (NetBird mesh IP, not public) |
| `HARBOR_REGISTRY` | Harbor hostname (e.g. `harbor.platform.internal`) |
| `HARBOR_USERNAME` | Harbor robot account username |
| `HARBOR_PASSWORD` | Harbor robot account password/token |
| `NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY` | NetBird reusable setup key for CI runners |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack incoming webhook for deploy notifications |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | Codecov upload token |
| `HCLOUD_TOKEN` | Hetzner Cloud API token (for Terraform) |

**Use in workflows:**

```yaml
env:
  DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DB_MIGRATION_URL }}
run: |
  echo "${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG_B64 }}" | base64 -d > ~/.kube/config
```

Full secrets table with rotation schedule is in `CICD_PIPELINE_REQUIREMENTS.md §Security`.

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Week 11: Staging Deployment

1. All Week 1-10 features merged to `staging` branch
2. Staging deploy triggers automatically via `deploy-staging.yml`
3. Team performs manual smoke test:
   - Create a test client via admin panel
   - Add a domain, verify DNS
   - Upload a test file via client panel
   - Create a test mailbox
   - Create a test database
4. Run load test: `gh workflow run load-test.yml -f duration=120 -f vus=10`
5. Fix all issues found; re-test
6. Only proceed to Week 12 once staging is stable for 48 hours

### Week 12: Production Deployment

1. Open PR from `staging` → `main`
2. Two team leads review and approve
3. Merge to `main` — this does **not** auto-deploy (production is manual)
4. Tag release: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
5. Trigger production deploy:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run deploy-production.yml \
     -f reason="Phase 1 MVP release — first Plesk customer migration" \
     -f image_tag="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
   ```
6. Approve the deployment in the GitHub Environment gate (1 approver required)
7. Monitor smoke test in Actions logs
8. Verify production health in Grafana: **Platform Operations → Overview**

## Dependency Map (Gantt-style)

**Critical Path:** Infrastructure → API → Panels → Testing

```
Weeks 1-2:  [Infrastructure]─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Weeks 3-4:                   [Management API]────────────────────────────────
Weeks 5-6:                                   [Admin Panel]───────────────────
Weeks 7-8:                                                 [Client Panel]────
Weeks 9-10:                  [Migration Service]──────────────────────────────
Weeks 11-12:                                                       [Testing + First Migration]
```

**Parallel Work:**
- While backend builds API (Wk 3-4), frontend builds panels using mock API data (Wk 5-8)
- While both build, DevOps builds migration service (Wk 9-10)
- Everything tested together in weeks 11-12

---

## Risk Mitigations

### Risk 1: API delays block everything
**Mitigation:**
- Frontend can build with mock API data
- Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for testing
- Create API mocks in week 2

### Risk 2: Database schema changes break migration
**Mitigation:**
- All DB changes through migrations (versioned)
- Test migrations weekly
- Keep rollback procedures documented

### Risk 3: First migration fails, customer loses data
**Mitigation:**
- Test migration with non-critical Plesk account first
- Build comprehensive migration validator
- Run validator before marking migration complete
- Have manual data restore procedure documented

### Risk 4: Performance issues discovered late
**Mitigation:**
- Load test early (week 10)
- Monitor response times in staging
- Set performance budgets (API < 200ms p50)

## Documentation Checklist

**Create in `/docs/` folder (or `/config/Server Infrastructure/`):**

- [ ] `README.md` — Quick start, local dev setup, deployment commands
- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE.md` — High-level system diagram (reference `PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- [ ] `API.md` — Link to OpenAPI spec + examples (reference `MANAGEMENT_API_SPEC.md`)
- [ ] `MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md` — Step-by-step Plesk migration guide (reference `BACKUP_EXPORT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
- [ ] `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — Common issues and fixes (start with CI/CD section from `CICD_PIPELINE_REQUIREMENTS.md`)

---

## Onboarding New Team Members

When adding a new developer to the project:

1. Add to GitHub org: `gh api orgs/hosting-platform/memberships/{username} --method PUT --field role=member`
2. Add to `platform-devs` team: `gh api orgs/hosting-platform/teams/platform-devs/memberships/{username} --method PUT`
3. Share NetBird setup key (via secure channel — not Slack plaintext)
4. Share `.env.example` files (via 1Password or equivalent)
5. Point to Developer Setup Checklist in `CICD_PIPELINE_REQUIREMENTS.md §Development Environment`
6. Assign first issue: a small, isolated backend or frontend task from the current week's backlog
7. First PR should be reviewed by two team members (good knowledge transfer opportunity)

---

## Communication Channels

**Use GitHub for:**
- Code reviews
- Design discussions (in PRs)
- Technical decisions (issues)
- Progress tracking (project board)

**Use Slack for:**
- Daily standup
- Quick questions
- Urgent issues
- Team announcements

**Sync meetings:**
- Monday morning: Plan week
- Wednesday: Mid-week check-in
- Friday: Review completed work
